# copy-controlled-decoding

This repository has code for paper [Controlling Decoding for More Abstractive Summaries with Copy-Based Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07038.pdf) 

Main CC Decoding code can be found in the file beam\_search.py. 


Please note that following points:

1. Code base is not really clean as it still has a bunch of things we had tried.
2. We thank see et. al. for the original code base found [here](https://github.com/abisee/pointer-generator).
