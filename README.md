# Copy-Controlled-decoding

This repository has code for paper [Controlling Decoding for More Abstractive Summaries with Copy-Based Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07038.pdf) 

Main CC Decoding code can be found in the file beam\_search.py. Please refer to the paper for the hyperparameter values that we used to run our experiments.

We will clean this code base in future, if possible. Currently it is not maintained.

Please note that following points:

1. Code base is not really clean as it still has a bunch of things we had tried.
2. We thank See et. al. for the original code base found [here](https://github.com/abisee/pointer-generator).
3. Please follow the original repository to learn how to get the data and run the code. 
4. For any queries send mail to any of the first authors: Noah Weber and Leena Shekhar (email in the paper).
